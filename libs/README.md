## Amazon SDK Libraries

- Download the [Amazon Mobile App SDK](https://developer.amazon.com/public/resources/development-tools/sdk) 
and extract the files to a directory on your hard drive.
- For more information please refer to main README for the plugin.

### Android

- Locate the LoginWithAmazon directory.
- Copy or move the `login-with-amazon.jar` file here.

### iOS

- You should see a LoginWithAmazon.framework directory in the LoginWithAmazon parent directory.
- This contains the Login with Amazon library. Put or link this folder here.
- Extra Tip for developers on Windows using TACO: Because NTFS doesn't handle symlinks well, you are advised to manually recreate the folders in the archive as directories and extracting the actual files out into those folders.
